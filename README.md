# Where is Microwave
## Website URL
Please visit https://minhao-zhang.github.io/where-is-microwave/
## Future Plan
This website/app in its final form will assist users to find available microwave ovens on campus (University of Washington - Seattle). It will also allow users to actively **add** new microwave oven or **report** a malfunctioning microwave oven. 

## Why I Made this Website
Starting this year, I moved out of the dorm and I have to cook for myself. I decide I will also pack my lunch for the sack of saving a buck. However, I did not find any instruction on official uw websites that could help me find one. In the searching process, I came across this reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/9jco8p/i_made_a_map_of_all_of_the_microwaves_on_campus/) which listed many available microwaves on campus and someone suggested making an app for this. So I did.

## Acknowledgement
This idea of making this websites comes from the reddit post I mentioned previously. I greatly appreciate [lucile-lucette](https://www.reddit.com/user/lucile-lucette/) creating the map in the first place. I am aware of previous projects like [this](https://github.com/sonyalao/microwave), but it is no longer maintained so I think I could create a new one.
